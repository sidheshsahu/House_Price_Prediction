## End-to-End House Price Prediction Pipeline with DVC, DAGsHub, and MLflow



### Description
This project implements a complete end-to-end House Price Prediction pipeline using DVC (Data Version Control), DAGsHub, and MLflow to streamline the machine learning workflow. The pipeline includes:

Data Collection & Versioning: Managed using DVC and stored on DAGsHub for reproducibility.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation for improved model performance.

Model Training & Evaluation: Used Random Forest model to predict house prices.

Experiment Tracking: MLflow is used to log and track model performance and hyperparameters.
